## 🧠 About the Challenge

> “Consistency is the bridge between goals and success.”  

The **#100DaysOfDataScience** challenge is all about building discipline and mastering Data Science concepts step by step — from fundamentals to advanced projects.

Each day, I commit to:
- Learning something new 📚  
- Practicing with real datasets 💻  
- Documenting my progress in this repo 📝  
- Sharing my learnings on LinkedIn & GitHub 🌐
